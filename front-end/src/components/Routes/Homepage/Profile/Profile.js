      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Kealan, a Maker’s Academy graduate and a jack of all trades when it comes to work experience most recently coming out of carpentry to pursue a career in Software Development. 
        Over the last 9 months, I’ve been coding every day to hone my skills in JavaScript to achieve this goal. 
        Since graduating from Maker’s I’ve built several projects using multiple technologies primarily JavaScript and React.
        I've also been using backend technologies like Mongo, Express and Node.js.

      <p>
      I liked moving around to keep things interesting and to always be learning something new, which is why I worked a lot of different jobs.
      I was able to learn a lot through these jobs and improve on my interpersonal skills because I work in a lot of customer facing jobs.
      Software Development seems to suit me because it's engaging as there's always something new to learn and more than enough chances to keep my skills sharp. 
      There's also a large active community which makes getting help a lot easier.
